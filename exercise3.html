	<h1>Hello, my name is Jacob.</h1>
	<h2>I am a pretty cool dude.</h2>
	<p>I am really enjoying learning html.</p>
	<h3>Structure</h3>
	<p>This is a paragraph<br>with a line break.</p>
	<em>This text is fancy</em>
	<strong>Bold text for strong statements</strong>
	<h3>Preformatting</h3>
	<pre>
	Marry had a <big>large</big> lamb.
	It looked like this!
	
	   /~00000~\       0000000
	  |~/ o o \~|000000000000000000
	   \ |   | /00000000000000000000__
	      \l/   0000000000000000000|\
		      | 0000000000000
		      | |         | |
		       w           w
	</pre>
	<code>Computer Code
	looking text uses a similar tag but ignores line breaks.</code>
	<h4>Quotes</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>This is useful when you have a long quotation<br> or a pull quote or just a section where you need<br>indented stuff.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>When the quote is smaller you included it inline. Like <cite>my mother</cite> always said,<br>
	<q>Give credit where it is due.</q>
	It is easier to find quotes when they are marked.</p>
